                <h3>How Analyst can use AI in cyber security</h3>
                <h4>AI Cyberseurity </h4>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in cybersecurity.
                   It is used to automate tasks that are highly repetitive, manually-intensive, and tedious for security analysts1.
                   AI enhances threat detection, prediction, and response capabilities by analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies.
                   AI can learn the context, environment, and behaviors associated with specific endpoints as well as asset types and network services.
                   It can then limit access to authorized devices based on these insights, and prevent access entirely for unauthorized and unmanaged devices.

                   AI in cybersecurity can also be used for automatic cyber threat detection, generating alerts, identifying new strands of malware, and protecting businesse sensitive data.
                   It can improve the efficiency of cybersecurity analysts, identify and prevent cyber threats more quickly, effectively respond to cyber attacks, and reduce cybersecurity costs.

                   In summary, AI is increasingly critical to protecting online systems from attacks by cyber criminals and unauthorized access attempts, making it an invaluable tool for cybersecurity
                   analysts. It not only enhances their threat intelligence capabilities but also saves them time discovering new threats4. This allows organizations to enhance their security investments
                   and improve operations without having to worry about finding additional skilled personnel.

                <h3>AI-driven cyber attacks to be the norm within a year, say security leadersCyber</h3>
                <h4>Cyber Attack AI Driven</h4>
                <p>
                    Recently AI has been constantly looked at the newest weapon to fight cyber attacks
                    with the ease of programing and algorithyms it is being used in offence and defence in the
                    cyber security battle. On that note AI is also starting to be used to create cyber attacksit is
                    enhancing the way cyber criminals are using to their benefit this new technology.
                    The pressure is on security leaders to do more with less, and so the rise of the use of AI to enhance cyber attacks could not have come at a worse time,
                    said Andy Still, CTO & Co-Founder, Netacea.
                    AI's power and low barrier to entry means that it will be used in many ways, including cyberattacks. While it's heartening that so many leaders recognise
                    the everyday threat they face from AI, there are gaps in understanding where the most damaging threats are coming from. In the arms race between offensive
                    and defensive AI, it's important to recognise that AI will be used anywhere it can be, and they need to respond in kind.
